In this project, we apply a full data science analysis process on the UCI Online Retail dataset. This includes visualizations, baseline modeling, dimensionality reduction, model selection, and unsupervised learning to cluster customer segments. <br>

First, we explore the data through exploratory data analysis and discover patterns in the data and clean the data of missing and skewed values. Then, we apply unsupervised approaches to cluster types of customers by frequency of purchases. We utilize K-means clustering and elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters. Our supervised approach then includes the comparison of 3 models: linear regression, decision tree, and random forest to predict the unit price of the items given other features in the data set. <br>

Finally, we perform some experimental time series analysis on the data.
